            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Taqi Alyousuf. I'm a junior majoring in Data Science, 
            and my hobbies are drawing and Arabic poetry. 
            This summer, I went home to Saudi Arabia and took summer classes online to spend time with friends and family. 
            After graduation, I'm contract-bound to work for my sponsoring company as an HR representative, 
            but my goal is to start my own data management company for businesses.
